# ITA Improcode Backend

Backend for IT Academy's [advanced React exercice](https://github.com/Readek/ITA-Improcode/edit/main/README.md).

This backend project uses NodeJS, Express and MongoDB with Mongoose to create an API for book stores and events, to read from and write to a database.

Yo to the [frontend's repo](https://github.com/Readek/ITA-Improcode/edit/main/README.md) to find out more.
